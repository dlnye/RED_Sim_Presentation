# RED_Sim_Presentation
A Jupyter notebook to share process for exploring the expected range of instrumental regression
coeficients under different assumed values of population parameters and sample sizes. The purpose 
is to guide the development of a sampling plan to estimate the behavior changes and, in turn, enery 
savings outcomes of using a smart phone app. This notebook was developed to facilitate a 1-hour 
discussion about the applications of statistical simulation for information study design.
